# Clock

## Description
Analog clock created using JS and CSS.   

## Purpose
I used WebDevSimplified's guide to create a basic clock which I will modify and add to for my own uses.  

## Future Improvements
1. Fresh color pallete with my own graphics
2. Add function to acknowledge every new hour
3. Light mode for am, dark mode for pm
